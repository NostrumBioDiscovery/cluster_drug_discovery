Analyze Dataset
--------------------------------------------

Tha analysis is based on:

- Silhouette index:  The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). Therefore, as high as possible the better.

- Calinski-Harabasz index: The score is defined as ratio between the within-cluster dispersion and the between-cluster dispersion.

- David-Bouldin index: The score refers to a model with better separation between the clusters.

  from sklearn import cluster, datasets, mixture
  import cluster_drug_discovery.methods.kmeans as ks

  X, y = datasets.make_blobs(n_samples=n_samples, random_state=random_state)
  cluster = ks.KmeansAlg(X, nclust=3)
  cluster.analysis_run() 


Silhouette

As seen in the pictures belowe as high the silhoutte coeficient 
is the better the clustering. As the silhoutte coefficient give us
a sense of how separate each point is from the other clusters

Carlinski
``````````````````

In terms of the  Calinski-Harabasz index the score is higher when clusters are dense and well separated,
which relates to a standard concept of a cluster. The score is fast to compute

Whereas, The Calinski-Harabasz index is generally higher for convex clusters than other concepts of clusters,
such as density based clusters like those obtained through DBSCAN.

David-Bouldin
```````````````````````

The David-Bouldin score refers to a model with better separation between the clusters since algorithms that produce clusters with low intra-cluster distances (high intra-cluster similarity) and high inter-cluster distances (low inter-cluster similarity) will have a low Davies–Bouldin index, the clustering algorithm that produces a collection of clusters with the smallest Davies–Bouldin index is considered the best algorithm based on this criterion.
